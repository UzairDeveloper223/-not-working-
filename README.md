    <title>Kali Linux Installation on Termux</title>
</head>
<body>

    <p>
        I have developed a script aimed at simplifying the installation process of Kali Linux on Termux. To begin, ensure you have Git installed using the command <code>apt install git</code>. Once Git is in place, the next step involves cloning the installation script from the provided GitHub repository. Execute <code>git clone https://github.com/UzairDeveloper223/INSTALL-KALI-Linux-on-Android-/blob/main/Installkali.sh</code> to retrieve the script. Subsequently, grant execute permissions to the script with <code>chmod +x Installkali.sh</code>. Finally, initiate the installation by running <code>./Installkali.sh</code>. These steps streamline the process, making it accessible for users to seamlessly install Kali Linux on their Termux environment.
